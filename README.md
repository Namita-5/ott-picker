# ott-picker

Case Scenario: Let us have a view at two people Ajay and Reema.

Reema is the marketing head of PVR solutions and is looking for a potential platform for advertising products of her firm.

Ajay is a very busy person, he is an employee in a company and is always short of time, although tired from his daily routine, he wants to take a break and decides to watch something on OTT platform to refresh his mind but he neither knows what to watch nor want to spend ample time on internet searching for a match.

Aim of this project is to help Ajay and Reema through data-oriented approach.
